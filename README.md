Conversation simulator
----------------------

This is a silly attempt to create a simple conversation simulator in Russian.
It uses some predefined inputs and outputs and also shortened bigrams and trigrams dictionaries in order to create random sentences.
The algorithm should be improved in order to create more complex sentences that make any sense.
